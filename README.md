~Homosexual Lady & The Tramp~
Part 0 (cause its a butthole)

The scene opens up, its raining outside by a starlit lamp, flickering in and out, casting its ugly yellow green color light upon the Earth.

A police car spins its lights as it passes by. Dogs barking in the distance. Nobody hears them barking anymore. It is a regular occurance around these parts now.

Its the police. The police are all gay now. They come for the Tramp because his wife and his gang are not being gay enough.

The dogs setout an underground railroad for Black dogs to escape the hells of homosexual prison in the domesticated facilities where they live.

The dogs setup a new policing system, one that actually understands and care about dog feelings, not the feelings of the white woman who called the cops in the first place cause she saw some dogs outside.

It's getting hectic out there. But Lady and the Tramp...

Lady is turning against the Tramp.

Word was let out that the Queen of Tramps wants him dead.

She can't take the stress.

The Tramp Queen, let out her dragons!
